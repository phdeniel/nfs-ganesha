NFS-GANESHA is packaged with the autotools products, it follows the classical './configure && make && make install' schema.

But, NFS-GANESHA is coming with different Namespaces' backends called FSAL (which stands for File System Abstraction Layer).
The selection of the FSAL to be compiled with is done at './configure' time, via the --with-fsal option

Compiling NFS-GANESHA with POSIX FSAL:
	./configure --with-fsal=POSIX && make && make install

Compiling NFS-GANESHA with SNMP FSAL:
	./configure --with-fsal=SNMP && make && make install

Compiling NFS-GANESHA with PROXY FSAL
	./configure --with-fsal=PROXY && make && make install

Compiling NFS-GANESHA for a "FUSE-like" binding
	./configure --with-fsal=FUSE && make && make install
	
Note: if no '--with-fsal=' is provided, the PROXY FSAL will be used.

/!\ : If you got the source tree via git (git clone for example), you do not have the autotools specific stuff. You have to install 
those from your machine. This is done by running "autoreconf --install" from src/ . This will as well generate the related ./configure
script.

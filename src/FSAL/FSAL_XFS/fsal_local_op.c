/**
 * FSAL_test_access :
 * Tests whether the user or entity identified by its cred
 * can access the object as indicated by the access_type parameter.
 * This function tests access rights using cached attributes
 * given as parameter.
 * Thus, it cannot test FSAL_F_OK flag, and asking such a flag
 * will result in a ERR_FSAL_INVAL error.
 *
 * \param cred (input):
 *        Authentication context for the operation (user,...).
 * \param access_type (input):
 *        Indicates the permissions to test.
 *        This is an inclusive OR of the permissions
 *        to be checked for the user identified by cred.
 *        Permissions constants are :
 *        - FSAL_R_OK : test for read permission
 *        - FSAL_W_OK : test for write permission
 *        - FSAL_X_OK : test for exec permission
 *        - FSAL_F_OK : test for file existence
 * \param object_attributes (mandatory input):
 *        The cached attributes for the object to test rights on.
 *        The following attributes MUST be filled :
 *        owner, group, mode, ACLs.
 *
 * \return Major error codes :
 *        - ERR_FSAL_NO_ERROR     (no error)
 *        - Another error code if an error occured.
